# Game Screen
The game screen serves as the main interface for player interaction, where all the gameplay unfolds. Its purpose is to enable the user to take control of a spaceship, which is under relentless assault from asteroids and enemy ships. The primary objective for the user on this screen is to eliminate all asteroids and enemy ships before progressing to the next level. As the game advances, each level becomes progressively more challenging.

The user has the ability to move their ship, fire bullets at enemy ships, rotate their ship, and hyperspace jump to a random location on the screen. <br>

# End Game/ High Scores

After exhausting all their lives, the game comes to an end for the user. They are immediately directed to a game over screen, which notifies them about the conclusion of the game and presents an option to proceed to the Enter Name screen.

On the Enter Name screen, the user is granted the ability to enter their username. Once submitted, both their username and corresponding score are appended to the scores list. Consequently, their score is regarded as a high score and will be showcased to all other players once they finish the game.

Prompted to input their username and press the enter key, the user advances to a screen where they can View High Scores. <br>
